# Twitter clone

This Twitter clone is composed from a frontend written in React and a backend written in Python.

In order to use, you have to load a tweets dataset from the Firebase 'Realtime database'. You can setup your Firebase account in the config.js file.

For the backend, you only need Flask installed.

I also would like to give some credit to [this](https://youtu.be/rJjaqSTzOxI) youtube tutorial which got me started on this Twitter clone.
